# ItunesExplorer

The ItunesExplorer is a prototype app which displays the results taken from the iTunes Search API with the keyword "star". The user can select any media from the results to view a more detailed description of the selection.

The app also records how many times the user has visited the said media, and when the last time it was accessed. This can be used to determine the user's interest level on the media, and the app can adapt accordingly (Maybe give a tempting discount if the user is interested greatly).

The Architecture used is MVVM - This is to prevent the view controller from bloating heavily from processing and creating the data used for the app
